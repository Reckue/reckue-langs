## Interactive language-learning helper.


<p>
It's your vocabulary-book built-in any pages you visit. 

You can interactively add, edit and mark words.
Marked words will take one of selected list of colors and turn into vocabulary card right in your browser!
</p>

#### How it works? 

No more necessary to create vocabulary cards for learning language by you own. <br>
Just read complex documents, books or whatever you like. <br>
Click on words and add them into your wordbook. <br>

Set your baseline familiarity with the word, start notice them more and move between levels when feel your knowledge. 

Save time learning new words by making it automatic!

## Build guide

1. Download dependencies and init npm project `npm install`

 Where `disc` it's your drive <br> and `full_patch` it's your full patch to project. 
   

3. Use `npm run build`, so you create 2 runnable files. <br>
   `page/page.js` and `popup/popup.js`
